#Goal
#Create a new RMarkdown document.
#Save it to disk.
#Knit the default document to HTML using ctrl/cmd-shift-k and examine the output
#Edit the default document so that it provides:
#some information about the iris data.frame, and
#one of your plots of the iris data including the code that generated it.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(diamonds)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .05)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
    geom_density(adjust = .1)
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, fill = cut)) +
    geom_histogram()
```
    stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, color = cut)) +
    geom_density()
```

Note that you can get rid of the line(s) across the bottom of density plot like so:
 geom_line(stat = "density")

## or ##
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~cut)
```
b. Which of the above plots would be more appropriate if we were interested in absolute quantity of diamonds of each cut, and which would be more appropriate if we were interested in the relative distribution of sizes within each cut? Why?
 The density curves are better for relative comparisons because the area under each is normalized 
 (so information about the number of diamonds within each cut-class is lost). 
 The histograms retain this information and so are preferable for comparisons of total quantity within each cut-class.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
    geom_boxplot()
    
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
    geom_violin() +
    facet_grid(color ~ clarity)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y = carat)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cut)) +
    facet_wrap(~clarity)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05) +
    geom_rug(alpha = .01)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05) +
    geom_rug(alpha = .01) +
    geom_smooth() +
    scale_x_log10() +
    scale_y_log10()
```
## geom_smooth: method="auto" and size of largest group is >=1000, so using gam with formula: y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"). Use 'method = x' to change the smoothing method.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05) +
    geom_rug(alpha = .01) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    scale_x_log10(limits = c(.25, 3)) +
    # or xlim(c(.1, 3))
    scale_y_log10()
    
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05, aes(color = cut)) +
    geom_rug(alpha = .01) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(color = cut)) +
    scale_x_log10(limits = c(.25, 3)) +
    scale_y_log10()
```
# Color gets lost in the rug plots, so they probably shouldn't be colored 
# (but perhaps you can see patterns where I don't). 
# The lines absolutely should be colored because we want to see if the slope 
# 3of the lines are different for the various `cut`s.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .05, aes(color = cut)) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(color = cut)) +
    scale_x_log10(name = "Size (carat)", limits = c(.25, 3), breaks = c(.5, 1, 2, 3)) +
    scale_y_log10(name = "Price (USD)") +
    annotation_logticks() +
    scale_color_discrete(guide = guide_legend(title = "Cut quality", reverse = TRUE)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 1),
          legend.justification = c(0, 1))
```
